# ***Repositories; What is Git and how to use them.***

Very simply speaking, a repository is a set of files that you have assigned Git to pay attention to.
It keeps track of previous versions of the code that has been written. The benefits of maintaining copies of previous versions (aka Version Control) of the code is that if there are any errors or causes for corruption in the code. 

Version Control revisits previous versions of files and directories. From this you can revert to previous versions, track modifications to files and who made those changes, and you can also compare versions if a newer version has caused an issue.
