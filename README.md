Hello everyone! My name is John. I am a student with the Code Fellows program (now in 201!) with minimal prior experience in software development. This website serves as a repository for the notes I take during my readings as well as an introduction to these topics for anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation. Learning software development can be difficult but hopefully my notes can help someone who may think it's too difficult.
