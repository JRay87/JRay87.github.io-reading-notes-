# Markdown

> ### ***HTML in a smaller package?***

Markdown is a simple syntax used to code for a website. With markdown you can:

- Put items into a list using a `-` before the item
    - These lists can be numbered or not
- Use different size headings depending on how many `#`s you place before the text
- ~~strike through~~ text using `~~`

Using the markodown language you can change the font style to **BOLD** with `**` or *Italics* with just one `*` etc.,

Markdown is not just used for simple text but it can also be used to display images, direct traffic and make connections between pages and sections, or keep track of your virtual tasks:

>- [ ] Bread
>- [x] Milk
>- [x] Trashbags
<!-- [ ] Deodorant -->

(How did my shopping list make it on here?) 

Luckily, using Markdown, people don't see I also need deodorant. 

Anyways, Markdown seems to be a very useful tool for simple coding projects but I'm not sure how versatile it is with bigger projects. Can it be used in combination with other languages such a Java, Python, Javascript (etc.,) IT seems to have the same basic functions of HTML but in a simpler format, at least that's what this day-1 student seems to think.
