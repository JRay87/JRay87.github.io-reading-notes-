# ***Day 11** - Assorted Topics (Images, Practical Info, A/V, and Flash*)

## ***HTML Chapter 6** - Images*

Images can be used in the background of of any element in your website but it is important to remember how that changes the overall presentation of your webpage. 

Images can be repeated accross the x-plain with `background-repeat: -x, -y, or no-repeat (allows one instance). 

The placement of the image will impact how the text reads. Pay attention to the contrast and opaqueness when deciding on image, placement, and text color. 

Other image tips included gradients which allow for color transition across the web page. This was not allowed on all older versions and should be given extra attention of other CSS rules allowing for a similar effect. 

Sprites are images used multiple times on a single page/interface. Common on storefront pages. 

## ***HTML Chapter 19** - Practical Information*

This chapter contained information on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) this was the use of the right words/image information making your website more easily located through web search algorithms. 

On Page includes using key words and phrases.

Off Page uses key words in the links instead of "click here" it uses "contact" or other information that may be in the users search query. This info could also be in the page titile, url, headings, text, link text, image alt text, and page descriptions. 

The best way to optimize your SEO includes identifying key words and phrases, using webpage analytics (to include google analytics). This tracks number of visits, unique visits, pages per visit, average time on site, etc., (where they're coming from and what they're looking at).

Also in this chapter was information on Domain names and hosting services. They are a series of computers always connected to the internet. They host your webpage files (through FTP), email hosting, bandwith allocation etc.,

## ***Chapter 9** - Flash*

Flash was developed to handle animations and allowed developers to play audio and video on webpages. It is no longer supported since the transtition to HTML 5 for these services.

## ***Article** - Video and Audio APIs*

As I mentioned above the transition to HTML 5 brought about the loss of flash. HTML 5 instituted `audio` and `video` elements. It allows the developer to link to a seperate browser with the video (if the user is on an older browser that doesn't support HTML 5) add controls like pause/ff/etc.,.

The visual features of the video player (as well as the controls) can be modified through CSS rules (put the media element within a div tag) to include opacity and can have hover effects to make it more visible.

Using JavaScript and `eventListeners`/`Handlers` you code the buttons to function as desired (play/pause, stop, skip forward/back). Be sure to clear any other functions when initializing your desired JS rule.

JavaScript allows for time tracking, scrolling, etc.,
