# ***CSS 2**- The Re-designing*

This day's readings are mainly review from previous lessons on CSS, but there was still important imformation I was able to pull out of them. 

## Article - Layout
Originally released in 1996 CSS has had 3 official named updates and 6 updated feature releases inbetween 1996 and 2021.

There was a reminder of the box around elements with margin, padding, etc.,

There are two layout mechanisms in CSS *'flexbox'* and *'grid'*.

***Flexbox*** put elements in one dimension (either horizontal or vertical.Defaults to inline.) The elements will stay on the same axis and not wrap. Converts its child elements to flex items (*behavior can be changed in the container*).

***Grid*** controls elements in multiple dimensions. Groups elements together and can create grids.

Other layouts include:

***Inline block*** - displays content in a box with some characteristics of block-level, but still flows inline with the text.

***Float*** - Tells the element to float in the specified area and content wraps around it.

***Multicolumn*** - Splits long columns into multiple columns to help with layout.

***Position*** - *changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements* (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky, static)
