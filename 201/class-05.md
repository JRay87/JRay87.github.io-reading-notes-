## HTML Chapter 5 - ***Images***
<img src="images201/robbie-noble-JGcaxNi2fQ8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Baseball Hat" title="Mets Hat by Robbie Noble"/>

Images can be used to relay information in a visualy appealing way and can have a major impact on the appeal of your site. One example of an image added to your site through is the following code:

`<img src="images201/robbie-noble-JGcaxNi2fQ8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Baseball Hat" title="Mets Hat"/>`

You can then use placement in HTML to change to how the image interacts with other content within your page. This can be done in HTML as well:

- Before p tag - text starts under the image
- Inside the opening p tag - text starts inline with the bottom of the image
- Inside the text - the text will display on the same level as the image

Following CSS rules you can also manipulate the image around the page. Changing size, placement, opacity etc.,

If you are using images remember, `.jpgs` for vivid images, `.gifs` (pronounced 'gifs') for simple images. (Please use animated gifs sparingly)

New in HTML5 is `figure` and `figcaption` These are used to display images with text as a caption under the image. 

## HTML Chapter 11 - ***Color***

With CSS rules we can change many different features besides just putting color on the screen (`background-color:`) and text color (`color:`). 

To really understand how we can effect the colors on the screen, we should first understand how the color value is expressed in CSS. Color can be expressed in RGB value, hex codes, or with the name (if the name has been pre-defined). Hovering over the color square also gives the developer access to a color square with sliders etc., to make any custom color combination.

From there they can also change the hue, saturation, or brightness.

Developers should remember that high contrast text is best for most text options because it makes the text easier to read. This changes however as the amount of text grows. Too much high contrast text leads to eye strain for the user, so pay close attention.

CSS3 gives the developer to some new color rules. These other color settings include the Opacity (`opacity:`) which makes the color more see through as the opacity decreases(?).
