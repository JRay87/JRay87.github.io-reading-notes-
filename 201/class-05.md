## HTML Chapter 11 - ***Color***

With CSS rules we can change many different features besides just putting color on the screen (`background-color:`) and text color (`color:`). 

To really understand how we can effect the colors on the screen, we should first understand how the color value is expressed in CSS. Color can be expressed in RGB value, hex codes, or with the name (if the name has been pre-defined). Hovering over the color square also gives the developer access to a color square with sliders etc., to make any custom color combination.

From there they can also change the hue, saturation, or brightness.

Developers should remember that high contrast text is best for most text options because it makes the text easier to read. This changes however as the amount of text grows. Too much high contrast text leads to eye strain for the user, so pay close attention.

CSS3 gives the developer to some new color rules. These other color settings include the Opacity (`opacity:`) which makes the color more see through as the opacity decreases(?).
