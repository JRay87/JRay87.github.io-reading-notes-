# ***The Growth Mindset***

I thought the article regarding ***The Growth Mindset*** was well done and it had some great advice for any of us who are nervous and brand new to this field.

## **Growth Mindset**
  
The growth mindset is a way of looking at obstacles, not as problems to avoid ***but*** as challenges to better one's self. By giving up or completely avoiding a problem we do ourselves a disservice. The struggle to accomplish something is where the most learning and self-improvement can be done.

### **Some of my major takeaways were**:

> - Make the conscious effort to challenge yourself and you'll feel better when all is said and done.

> - When things become challenging, it is better to walk away momentarily in an effort to readjust and reattack when refreshed. Do not sit and struggle til you quit out of frustration.

> - Search out the assistance, advice, and critiques of your network. It can help put your work into perspective. Do not, however, place value on your work based on the success or failures of others. We are all in this to produce the best product and be the best coders we can be. Helping each other out only makes the group better.
