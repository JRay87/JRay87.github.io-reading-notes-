# **JavaScript**

## *Not code for coffee, but it sure will get your website moving.* 

So we've learned about HTML (The Bones) and CSS (The Skin), well now its time to discuss (The Muscles) aka JavaScript. Think of JavaScript as what makes your webpage interactable with both the end user and the servers. The browser is acting as the middle man, and JavaScript will tell it where to go and who to talk to. 

To use JavaScript you start off by declaring an element as a variable. There are three different types of variables; let, var, and const.

>let - this value may change, but for now this is the value.

>var - used by older platforms, this

>const - this is a value that isn't supposed to cahnge
